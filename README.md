# odin-website
Website project for The Odin Project

March 1 - Initial commit.


March 4 - Began building. HTML framework, most content (minus images) and initial selectors added. I will likely change these as I start adding flex, but gotta start someplace. Initial CSS stylings added, mostly background and text colors. 


March 10 - Set up dual boot on my laptop and realized that I didn't commit changes since 4 Mar. So kinda started over there. Added images from pexels.
